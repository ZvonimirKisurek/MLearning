/**
 * Server vs Client split on this page:
 *   - This page and <CommandCenter> are Server Components: they call the API on the server (token stays secret,
 *     no client waterfall), and their output is HTML streamed to the browser.
 *   - <Suspense> lets the static shell paint immediately; the skeleton shows until /api/today resolves.
 *   - Only the pieces that need interactivity are Client Components: MissionBoard (optimistic checkboxes),
 *     PendingBriefing (polling), SkillProgress (Recharts). They receive server data as serialisable props.
