"""AI summaries for the feed.

Each ingested article carries only the feed's own excerpt (often a teaser, sometimes HTML boilerplate). A
small, cheap model rewrites title+excerpt into 1-2 neutral sentences so the feed is scannable. Two honest limits:

  * It summarises the EXCERPT, never the full article (we don't download full pages). The UI labels it "AI summary".
  * Feed text is untrusted input flowing through an LLM into a stored field. The prompt says so, the text is
    XML-escaped, validators forbid URLs, and the frontend renders it as plain text (React escapes by default),
    so an injected instruction can at worst produce a bad summary - never code execution or a rogue link.

Batching 10 articles per call amortises the system prompt; Haiku-class pricing makes ~60 articles/run negligible.
