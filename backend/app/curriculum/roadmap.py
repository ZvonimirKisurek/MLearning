"""A fixed multi-week roadmap that steers the weekly generator.

Without a roadmap the weekly theme is *emergent*: the LLM weighs your skill gaps against this week's news.
With one, the roadmap is the SPINE (what to learn, in what order) and the news only chooses timely readings and
current tooling. Why bother? An LLM planning week by week optimises locally; it will happily chase this week's
hype. A curriculum is a global plan: foundations before applications (retrieval -> training -> deployment -> LLM
internals), each week's deliverable feeding the next.
