"""Weekly retrospective numbers + an honest click-through detector.

Completing a task is a *behaviour signal*, not proof of learning: a checkbox can be ticked without reading anything.
This module reports the behaviours that separate real work from box-ticking (building vs only reading, ticks
spread over the day vs three ticks in one minute, ticks on the right day vs days later) and the skill movement
the formula granted. The judgement of whether you can DO the thing stays with you: see docs/RETROSPECTIVE.md.
