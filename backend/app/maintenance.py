"""Retention. Each canonical article costs ~12 KB (1536 float32 = 6 KB for the vector, plus its HNSW index
entry). At a few hundred new articles a day that reaches a 500 MB free database in a few months, so old rows go.

Invariant: `article_days` must exceed `max_item_age_days` (30). Ingestion refuses items older than that, so a feed
that still lists a pruned article cannot resurrect it as "new".
