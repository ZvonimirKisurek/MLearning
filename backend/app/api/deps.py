"""FastAPI dependencies: settings, the async DB pool, per-request connections, auth, task queue.

WHY ASYNC?  FastAPI runs on an event loop: one thread juggles many in-flight requests. A request that awaits
the database *yields* the thread, so while Postgres works on query A the loop serves request B. A blocking
(sync) driver would freeze the loop for every other client for the duration of each query. `psycopg`'s
AsyncConnectionPool gives us true non-blocking I/O. (Celery workers and the CLI keep using the sync pool in
app/db.py: they are single-job processes where blocking is fine.)

CONNECTION LIFECYCLE: one pool per process (opened/closed in `lifespan`), one *borrowed connection per request*.
`async with pool.connection()` is also a transaction: it COMMITs when the block exits cleanly and ROLLBACKs on an
exception - so a failing endpoint can never leave half-applied writes.
